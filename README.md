# pairAnalysis
v8
Added normalised dPhi distribution and ability to save selected pairs tree.

v6
Many changes, including timing, sub-pixelisation, event monitor...

v4_1
Removed reference to version numbers from file names so that changing "version" doesn't require changing filenames and adding/removing. Simply change the verions refered to in the Makefile (to create appropriately named execuatable) and the analysis_setup.
